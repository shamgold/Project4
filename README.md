# Project 4

Shamber Goldstein | March 13, 2020 | B ME 450 | Project 4: Hydrophone

## Introduction:

This projeProject 4's goal is to analyze noise in the ocean from wind, rain, mammal vocalization, air guns, and a volcanic eruption or earthquake [1]. These noises are possible to evaluate through the use of a hydrophone, "a passive acoustic sensor (an underwater microphone) that converts sound energy to electrical energy, with a binary stream output" [2]. The hydrophone raw data was extracted from the Ocean Obervatories Initiative website [3] which allows the user to select an instrument, location, depth, date, and time for data collection. Part 1 of the project is to analyze the power spectral density for the wind and rain readings at times when it is windy and not rainy, rainy and not windy, windy and rainy, and not windy or rainy. Plotting this against frequency, allows the user to analyze the effect of rain and wind on underwater noise. These plots are to be made for the Oregon shelf site and the Oregon offshore site. Part 2 of the project is to plot spectograms for times in the hydrophone data at any location that there is a marine mammal vocalization, and air gun noise, and a volcano eruption or earthquake, then compare their bandwidths with what is shown on the Wenz Curve (Figure 12).

## Analysis/Conclusions:

What is the effect of wind and rain on underwater noise? Explain any behavior you observe in your result. 

Which one has the highestimpact? Rain or wind?

What arethe main reasons for observing different spectral levels in Oregon shelf compared to Oregon offshore? 

Compare the bandwidth of the three signals in Part 2. Are they consistent with what is shown in the Wenz curve?
